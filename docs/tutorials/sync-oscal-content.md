# The complyscribe command line sync-oscal-content Tutorial

This tutorial provides how to use `complyscribe sync-oscal-content` sync OSCAL models to [cac-content](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content).

Currently, this command has three sub-command: `component-definition` and `profile` and `catalog`

## component-definition

This command is to sync OSCAL Component Definition information to CaC content side.

The CLI performs the following sync:

- Sync OSCAL Component Definition parameters/rules changes to CaC content control file
- Add a hint comment to the control file when a missing rule is found in the CaC content repo.
- Sync OSCAL Component Definition control status changes to CaC content control file. Since status mapping between
cac and OSCAL is many-to-many relationship, if status can not be determined when sync, then add a comment to let user
decide. Discussion detail in [doc](https://github.com/complytime/complyscribe/discussions/511)
