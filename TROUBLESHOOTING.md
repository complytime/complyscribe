# Troubleshooting


## Action does not commit changes back to the correct branch

Verify the trigger you are using. The default branch is set to `github.ref_name`. If triggered on a pull request, you may notice this set to `pr-number/merge`. Set the branch field to `github.heaf_ref` which is set during pull request triggered workflows.

## Action does not have permission to commit/pull_request

If your workflow requires that this action make changes to your branch, ensure the token being used has `content: write` permissions and the token is being set.

```yaml
## Defaults to ${{ github.token }}
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
```

If your workflow requires that this action create a pull request (`target_branch` is set), ensure the token being used has `pull_request: write` permissions and the token is being set.

```yaml
# github_token has no default. 
# To use default token use ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
- uses: RedHatProductSecurity/complyscribe@main
  with:
    markdown_path: "markdown/profiles"
    assemble_model: "profile"
    target_branch: "main"
    github_token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
```

> Note: Using the GitHub token provided with GitHub Actions to commit to a branch will [NOT trigger additional workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow).
